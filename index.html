<h1>Del Mar Hills is better then Del Mar Heights!</h1>
<p>Recent studies show that Del Mar Hills, is better than Del Mar Heights for many reasons! First off, Max Norman, a Del Mar Hills alumni, says he never had a bad year! Jeff, a Del Mar heights alumni says it sucked! Del Mar Hills is a smaller school, making it better for the people who go there. They get more 1 on 1 time with the teachers, and everyone knows each other. Del Mar Hills is also more diverse. Del Mar Height’s property is also ocean front, making it super expensive for the district! Problematic. Eli Browne, a student who left after 6 years at the hills, but didn’t do 6th grade there, said that he made great friends at Del Mar Hills and it’s harder to do that at a bigger school like the one he is at now. On top of all that, Del Mar Hills has an orchestra, something no other schools in the district have. As they say at Del Mar Hills, “Hills kills, Heights Bite!”</p>
